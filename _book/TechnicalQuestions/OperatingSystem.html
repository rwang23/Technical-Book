<h2 id="acid-and-cap">ACID and CAP</h2>
<h3 id="acid">ACID</h3>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity: either all occur, or nothing occurs</li>
<li>Consistency: Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers</li>
<li>Isolation: isolation determines how transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems. For example, when a user is creating a Purchase Order and has created the header, but not the Purchase Order lines, is the header available for other systems/users, carrying out concurrent operations (such as a report on Purchase Orders), to see?</li>
<li>Durability: guarantees that transactions that have committed will survive permanently. For example, if a flight booking reports that a seat has successfully been booked, then the seat will remain booked even if the system crashes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cap">CAP</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consistency (All Nodes Have Same Data via Eventual Consistency)</li>
<li>Availability</li>
<li>Partition-Tolerance : system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="difference">Difference</h3>
<p>CAP theorem: specifies that a distributed system can provide two services (ex. Availability and Partition tolerance) but never three. If for example, a service provides Availability and Partitioning it can never ensure Consistency, not immediately, thus Eventual Consistency is used, which allows the infrastructure to flux between inconsistency and consistency, however at one point, sooner or later, the infrastructure will become consistent, resulting in eventual consistency. Cloud services work in such fashion and Amazon&apos;s Simple DB uses eventual consistency.</p>
<p>ACID features are usually applied to relational DBs. If you want to apply ACID in a distributed fashion (distributed DB), ACID uses 2PC(two-phase commit) to force consistency across partitions. However since ACID provides consistency and partitioning, applying the CAP theorem for (distributed environments) this will mean that availability is compromised.</p>
<p>Because of this, BASE (Basically available, soft state, eventually consistent) is used which can provide levels of scalability that cannot be obtained with ACID.</p>

<pre><code>getName(): It is used for Obtaining a thread&#x2019;s name
getPriority(): Obtain a thread&#x2019;s priority
isAlive(): Determine if a thread is still running
join(): Wait for a thread to terminate
run(): Entry point for the thread
sleep(): suspend a thread for a period of time
start(): start a thread by calling its run() method
</code></pre><h4 id="create-thread">Create thread</h4>
<p>A thread can be created in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>By extending Thread class</li>
<li>By implementing Runnable interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thread-creation-by-implementing-runnable-interface">Thread creation by implementing Runnable Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once the thread is created it will start running when start() method gets called. Basically start() method calls run() method implicitly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="thread-creation-by-extending-thread-class">Thread creation by extending Thread class</h3>
<ul>
<li>The class should override the run() method which is the entry point for the new thread as described above.</li>
<li>Call start() method to start the execution of a thread.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-runnable-interface-vs-extending-thread-class">Implementing Runnable Interface VS Extending Thread class</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extending the Thread class will make your class unable to extend other classes, because of the single inheritance feature in  JAVA. However, this will give you a simpler code structure. If you implement Runnable, you can gain better object-oriented design and consistency and also avoid the single inheritance problems.</li>
<li>If you just want to achieve basic functionality of a thread you can simply implement Runnable interface and override run() method. But if you want to do something serious with thread object as it has other methods like suspend(), resume(), ..etc which are not available in Runnable interface then you may prefer to extend the Thread class.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interthread-communication">Interthread Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>wait() tells the calling thread to give up the monitor and go to sleep until some other thread enters the same monitor and calls notify().</li>
<li>notify() wakes up the first thread that called wait() on the same object.</li>
<li>notifyAll() wakes up all the threads that called wait() on the same object. The highest priority thread will run first.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multi-threading-condition">Multi-Threading condition</h3>
<ul>
<li>In multitasking systems, some abnormal conditions prevent progress of executing processes or threads. I&apos;ll refer to both processes and threads simply as &quot;processes&quot;. Two of these conditions are called dead-lock and live-lock.</li>
<li>The former refers to processes which are blocking each other, thus preventing either from executing. The latter refers to processes which prevent each other from progressing, but do not actually block the execution. For instance, they might continually cause each other to rollback transactions, neither ever being able to finish them.</li>
<li>Another condition is known as resource starvation, in which one or more finite resources, required for the progress of the processes, have been depleted by them and can&apos;t be restored unless the processes progress. This is also a special case of live-lock.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://richardbarabe.wordpress.com/2014/02/21/java-deadlock-livelock-and-lock-starvation-examples/" target="_blank">Starvation</a>
Starvation and livelock are much less common a problem than deadlock, but are still problems that every designer of concurrent software is likely to encounter.</p>
<h4 id="starvation">Starvation</h4>
<p>Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources and is unable to make progress.
This happens when shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by &quot;greedy&quot; or higher priority threads. For example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.</p>
<h3 id="deadlock">Deadlock</h3>
<p>Deadlock, the ultimate form of starvation, occurs when two or more threads are waiting on a condition that cannot be satisfied. Deadlock most often occurs when two (or more) threads are each waiting for the other(s) to do something.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-solve-deadlock">How to solve deadlock</h3>
<h4 id="lock-ordering">Lock Ordering</h4>
<p>Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order.</p>
<p>If you make sure that all locks are always taken in the same order by any thread, deadlocks cannot occur. Look at this example:</p>
<h4 id="lock-timeout">Lock Timeout</h4>
<p>Another deadlock prevention mechanism is to put a timeout on lock attempts meaning a thread trying to obtain a lock will only try for so long before giving up.</p>
<h4 id="deadlock-detection">Deadlock Detection</h4>
<p>Deadlock detection is a heavier deadlock prevention mechanism aimed at cases in which lock ordering isn&apos;t possible, and lock timeout isn&apos;t feasible.</p>
<p>Every time a thread takes a lock it is noted in a data structure (map, graph etc.) of threads and locks. Additionally, whenever a thread requests a lock this is also noted in this data structure.</p>
<p>When a thread requests a lock but the request is denied, the thread can traverse the lock graph to check for deadlocks</p>
<h3 id="livelock">Livelock</h3>
<p>A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other thread&apos;s action is also a response to the action of another thread, then livelock may result. Livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads are not blocked &#x2014; they are simply too busy responding to each other to resume work. This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor: Livelock occurs when two people meet in a narrow corridor, and each tries to be polite by moving aside to let the other pass, but they end up swaying from side to side without making any progress because they always both move the same way at the same time</p>

<pre><code class="lang-java">Blockingqueue&lt;object&gt; blockingqueue = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;<span class="hljs-number">10</span>&gt;();
</code></pre>
<h4 id="what-is-blockingqueue">What is Blockingqueue</h4>
<ul>
<li>BlockingQueue is a queue which is thread safe to insert or retrieve elements from it.</li>
<li>Also, it provides a mechanism which blocks requests for inserting new elements when the queue is full or requests for removing elements when the queue is empty, with the additional option to stop waiting when a specific timeout passes.</li>
<li>This functionality makes BlockingQueue a nice way of implementing the Producer-Consumer pattern, as the producing thread can insert elements until the upper limit of BlockingQueue while the consuming thread can retrieve elements until the lower limit is reached and of course with the support of the aforementioned blocking functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="queues-vs-blockingqueues">Queues vs BlockingQueues</h4>
<ul>
<li>A java.util.Queue is an interface which extends Collection interface and provides methods for inserting, removing or inspecting elements. First-In-First-Out (FIFO) is a very commonly used method for describing a standard queue, while an alternative one would be to order queue elements in LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).</li>
<li>However, BlockingQueues are more preferable for concurrent development.</li>
<li>it provides a mechanism which blocks requests for inserting new elements when the queue is full or requests for removing elements when the queue is empty, with the additional option to stop waiting when a specific timeout passes.</li>

<p>Serialization is the conversion of an object to a series of bytes, so that the object can be easily saved to persistent storage or streamed across a communication link. The byte stream can then be deserialized - converted into a replica of the original object.</p>
<h4 id="protobuf">ProtoBuf</h4>
<ul>
<li>Google protocol buffers, popularly known as protobuf is an alternate and faster way to serialize Java object. It&apos;s a good alternative of Java serialization and useful for both data storage and data transfer over network.</li>
<li>It&apos;s open source, tested and most importantly widely used in Google itself</li>
